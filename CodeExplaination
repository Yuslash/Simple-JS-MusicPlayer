JavaScript Music Player Code Explanation

1. Define audio elements for each song:
   - Three audio elements (Ghost, faded, and stay) are created for each song, specifying the file path of each song.

2. Select DOM elements:
   - DOM elements representing player controls (play, pause, next, and previous buttons) and song information display (song name and image) are selected using querySelector.

3. Define an array of song objects:
   - An array named 'songs' contains objects for each song, including the audio element, song name, and image URL.

4. Event listeners for song ending:
   - Event listeners are added to each audio element to handle the 'ended' event, which triggers when a song finishes playing. When a song ends, it automatically proceeds to the next song.

5. Function to play or pause the current song:
   - The 'playpausesong' function toggles between playing and pausing the current song when the play/pause button is clicked.

6. Event listeners for player controls:
   - Event listeners are added to the play/pause, next, and previous buttons to handle user interactions and call the 'playpausesong' function accordingly.

7. Function to update the current song:
   - The 'updateSong' function updates the current song based on the action (next or previous) and updates the song information displayed on the player interface.
